Class project dealing with a queue which keeps track of two heaps, a min and a max, 
where each heap's item has a value and an index of the location of the same value
in the other heap..

For example:

Max = [(100, 3), (18, 1), (42, 2), (0, 0)]
Min = [(0, 3), (18, 1), (42, 2), (100, 0)]

In a very crude sense

possibly buggy, who knows. meant to sort and exercise through 2^20 numbers
